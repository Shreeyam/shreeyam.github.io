Hello,

My name is Shreeyam Kacker, I am a researcher in space technology, focusing on laser communications and spacecraft autonomy through deep learning. I am affiliated with the MIT Space Telecommunications, Astronomy and Radiation (STAR) Lab led by Professor Kerri Cahoy.

I received an SM in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT in 2022 and an MEng in Aeronautical Engineering from Imperial College London in 2020.

Currently I work for Planet Labs in San Francisco working on edge compute and improving spacecraft autonomy. 

I'm reachable through email at `shreeyam at [mit.edu|planet.com]`.
